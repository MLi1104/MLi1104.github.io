        This page will introduce to you what I do when I practice selfcare. Selfcare is so important in an age of hustle and bustle. During COVID, a lot of people's selfcare routines are greatly distrubed and their sleep are completely off. Teenagers' emergency
        room visits due to mental health related reasons are more frequent than ever.The work culture in the United States is not helping the issue. So, let me share with you my mental health care process.

                <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>I love reading, but reading can feel stressful when I am already stressed because it feels too much like school. However, some comforting books I can always go to are: Jane Eyre, The Night Circus, Little Women, Howl's Moving Castle, and
                    the Harry Potter books!

                <h2>Podcasts</h2>
                <p>Podcasts are so awesome. I got into them during the Pandemic. Some of my favorites that I would recommend to everyone are: "Harry Potter and the Sacred Text", "The Daily" by the New York Times, "Witch, Please", and "Ghibliotechque"</p>

                <h2>Audiobooks</h2>
                <p>I alternate between audiobooks and podcasts. They are in a separate category from reading because I feel the words more acutely when I listen to the story. I use audiobooks.com to download my favorites.</p>

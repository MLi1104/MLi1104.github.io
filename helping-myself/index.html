                <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>I love reading, but reading can feel stressful when I am already stressed because it feels too much like school. However, some comforting books I can always go to are: Jane Eyre, The Night Circus, Little Women, Howl's Moving Castle, and
                    the Harry Potter books!

                <h2>Podcasts</h2>
                <p>Podcasts are so awesome. I got into them during the Pandemic. Some of my favorites that I would recommend to everyone are: "Harry Potter and the Sacred Text", "The Daily" by the New York Times, "Witch, Please", and "Ghibliotechque"</p>

                <h2>Audiobooks</h2>
                <p> I alternate between audiobooks and podcasts. They are in a separate category from reading because I feel the words more acutely when I listen to the story. I use audiobooks.com to download my favorites.</p>

                <p>Stress baking always produces good results. I am not very good but that is not the point of it. My favorite recipe to stress bake is chocolate chip cookies.</p>

                <h2>Movies</h2>
                <p>Movies are a must during crisis mode. I usually alternate between Ghibli films, modern classics, and Chinese dramas.</p>
                <p class="big-text">I have also made a website that has more details on my attachment to Studio Ghibli:</p>

                <p>It always feel good to create something when stressed. I try to only focus on my creation so I don't get distracted by stressful things.</p>

            Selfcare is so important in an age of <span class="white">hustle and bustle</span>. During <span class="white">COVID-19</span>, a lot of people's selfcare routines are <span class="white"> greatly disturbed </span> and their sleep schedules
            are completely off. Teenagers' <span class="white"> emergency room </span>visits due to mental health related reasons are more frequent than ever.The work culture in the United States is <span class="white">not</span> helping the issue. So,
            let me share with you my
            <span class="white">mental health care process</span>.

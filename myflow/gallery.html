                    <p>Spirited Away is, in my opinion, the best movie of all time It is a tender protrayal of a little girl who has to grow up too fast. I don't think any work of art/literature has as profound of an impact on me as Spirited Away has.

                    <p>From Up on Poppy Hill does not get as much love as it should have. The visuals are stunning and the characters intriguing. We all need a Umi in our lives.

                    <p>Markl is one of my favorite characters from Studio Ghibli. He is way too cool in Howl's.

                    <img src="images/totoro.jpg" alt="totoro picture">
                    <p>Totoro does not have as special of a place in my heart as some of the other ones do. But this movie is pure joy. I enjoyed the ride for as long as it has lasted.
